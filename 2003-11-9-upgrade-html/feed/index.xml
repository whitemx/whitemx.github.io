					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;the solution for the snail-link networking was a bit odd. i had to remove the xp drivers (which as the most recent i had assumed would be best) and put on the old nt4.0 drivers for my 3com network card.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; a bit odd but at least it seems to work. in fact it seems to be faster than when it was running under win2k.&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>
