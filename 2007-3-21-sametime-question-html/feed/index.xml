					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Thanks Carl, that&#039;s pretty much what I had gathered. A strange one really that will hopefully get fixed pretty soon.&lt;br  /&gt;&lt;br  /&gt;Matt&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Right now, it has not been documented on how you can send a clickable URL, rich text etc. to the Sametime 7.5 client.  IBM Say this will be documented for Sametime 7.5.1 GA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br  /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br  /&gt;Also there is a difference between the Sametime 7.5 and sametime 7.0 and earlier clients in that Announcement URLs are not clickable.  This was identified in st 7.5 beta, but IBM didn&#039;t fix it, I haven&#039;t yet checked to see if they addressed this in ST 7.5.1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br  /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br  /&gt;So sending an announcment with a clickable link, not possible in regular ST, but is possible with STLinks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br  /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br  /&gt;Sending a regular text message can include a URL, which the ST Client will automatically make clickable.&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>
