					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I feel your pain.  One night, I tried to meet my wife at Magic Kingdom.  When I got off the bus, I noticed rain coming down.  It was slow at first and quickly started to down pour with flashes of lightning.  I saw people running out of the park and I thought this would be great if the rain stopped.  Then, I see my wife and sister run past me in a panic just as I entered the park.  I had my headphones on and I ripped them off my head.  I thought I checked to make sure the little ear covers were it tact.  When I returned to the room, a little wet, one was gone.  That really annoyed me.  These are Sony headphones and I&#039;ve now lost all three pairs of ear covers.   The next day, I bought the IBM headphones for $5.95.  They sounded awful so I used the ear covers on my Sony and although they are black and the headphones white, they worked.  A set of these babies are $10.  The headphone challenge continues. &lt;br  /&gt;Nice chatting with you at Lotusphere!&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>
