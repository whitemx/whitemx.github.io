					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Matt, I have exactly the same keyboard issue! I type a lot more errors than before. I’m pretty sure it&#039;s due to the keys being a bit bigger and thus further apart. And like you, it has only improved slightly over the past months.&lt;br/&gt;Otherwise (except for needing a dongle for everything you want to connect), it’s a lovely machine.&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>
