					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I thought I might suggest a birthday present idea maybe to those in the family struggling to know what to get me. I really enjoy Maeve Binchy books and the one I like the look of at the moment is called &quot;Irish Girls about Town&quot; written by various writers including Maeve Binchey, Marian Keyes, Cathy Kelly &amp; Colette Caddle etc, Maybe this would be a presie idea for Si &amp; Fi if not already decided.&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>
