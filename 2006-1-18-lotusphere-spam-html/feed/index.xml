					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;The only Lotusphere I&#039;ve ever been to was in Berlin in 2000. Yet all of a sudden, this year, &lt;b&gt;the year I&#039;m attending LS &quot;proper&quot;, &lt;/b&gt;I start getting LS-related spam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hmmm...!&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Mathew,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I noticed the same thig and called a couple of them on it and both said that they had got my email in past years at Lotusphere when I swiped my badge at their booths.  Not sure if this is 100% true but I did realize that I used a personal email address to register for LS this year and to date it has not got any LS SPAM.  Still aggrevating but I guess maybe a little less so.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Neil.&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>
