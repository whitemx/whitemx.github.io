					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;The Olympics has certainly entertained us for the last month, we&#039;ve sadly not done as well in the swimming or field and track events, Paula Radcliffe really tried but sadly stopped on the last leg of the marathon, she deserves a normal life now she&#039;s been through alot. &lt;br/&gt;I&#039;s sad that so many Atheletes turn to drugs, and go and pull out once there too, where as they could have given someone else that opportunity to compete. &lt;br/&gt;The Rowing has been fantastic along with the Kayaking and Equestrian events. &lt;/p&gt;]]></description>
