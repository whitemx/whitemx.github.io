					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I have to say I like the Outlook client.  We use Outlook 2003 and Exchange 2003.  Type ahead is great, I like being able to recall messages if I forget to attach something, and the interface is fairly intuitive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That said, I must admit that I don&#039;t use it offline at all (not worth the hassle IMHO), We do have OWA (Outlook Web Access) running in our environment, and it&#039;s 2003 also.  That makes being remote much easier.  I also don&#039;t do a lot of filing away in folders, etc.  I read my e-mail, save attachments off somewhere if I need to keep them, and delete the rest.  I don&#039;t get complex with it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tom&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I did consider running mail (as well as this site) from home but my broadband is so flakey that I would be worried about missing mail. Maybe it&#039;s time to switch ADSL supplier as well?&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I recently spent 9 months working at a client who used Outlook. One thing I really didn&#039;t like about Outlook was the inability to put one message in multiple folders without copying it. Then the fact that I couldn&#039;t full text index my mail. Apparently you can enable mail indexing on the server, but that never seems to get done. I tried the Google plug in to help search my mail, but I couldn&#039;t get satisfactory results. Of course if a message was in multiple folders, a search would return multiple hits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another great thing about Notes is soft deletions. Notes automatically empties my trash after X hours. Outlook either prompted me every time I closed it, or the trash would fill up and my generous 12 Mb (yes twelve!) would overflow every few days prompting more annoying messages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I use Notes mail for my personal mailbox, and have done for years. I do, however, run a Notes server at home, which is not practical for most people (peer to peer replication would be great!). But I can take my mail file with me when I travel, and process my mail from a hotel room. Upon returning, everything is synched after replication. I works for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If any family or friends ask me about email, these days I always recommend an online service over a local mail client. You can get your mail from anywhere, and their spam filtering works so well I would never think of doing it in a client.&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>
