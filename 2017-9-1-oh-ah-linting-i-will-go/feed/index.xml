					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;As far as JavaScript isn&#039;t strongly typed, you can always go down the TypeScript road. This does provide stronger typing to your JavaScript and brings JavaScript more inline with Java/C#. The great thing about it is, once implemented you don&#039;t really have to change anything about your existing codebase because TypeScript IS JavaScript, it just adds typings to it. I&#039;ve been using it for about 6 months now and I love it. You&#039;re able to define abstract classes, classes, inheritance, interfaces, enums, etc. which really helps on a large project.&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>
