					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Matt,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br  /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br  /&gt;I&#039;m glad you like your new iPhone.  I too am one of the lucky ones and I love mine.  I hope I like it even more than the original.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br  /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br  /&gt;I also picked up the invisibleSHIELD (it is the only protective film carried by CPW).  I got the original invisibleSHIELD on my first iPhone and have it on my iPod as well.  I get it for all my gadgets.  I&#039;ve learned from painful experience that I need something to keep my toys looking new.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br  /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br  /&gt;Apple has another huge hit with the new iPhone, I think they&#039;re taking over the world! :)  I can&#039;t wait for the new iPods to come out in September.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br  /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br  /&gt;Cheers&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

<p>I&#8217;m glad you like your new iPhone.  I too am one of the lucky ones and I love mine.  I hope I like it even more than the original.</p>
<p>I also picked up the invisibleSHIELD (it is the only protective film carried by CPW).  I got the original invisibleSHIELD on my first iPhone and have it on my iPod as well.  I get it for all my gadgets.  I&#8217;ve learned from painful experience that I need something to keep my toys looking new.</p>
<p>Apple has another huge hit with the new iPhone, I think they&#8217;re taking over the world! ðŸ™‚  I can&#8217;t wait for the new iPods to come out in September.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
