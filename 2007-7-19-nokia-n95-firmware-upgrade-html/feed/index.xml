			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A better battery life then, but still not quite what I want.</p>
<p>I plan on using a lot of data services &#8211; I already do on my old Nokia 7610 &#8211; so I suspect I&#8217;ll hammer the battery too much on an N95.</p>
<p>So I guess I&#8217;ll just have to wait for the E90&#8230;  *sighs*</p>
<p>Thanks for your impressions Matt!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s a very good handset and if you just use it as a phone then the battery life is  fine. Of course it does so much more than just phonecalls that if you don&#039;t use the features you may as well just have a Razr or something. So if you use the media player, GPS or any of the other advanced features you are literally looking at the battery being drained within 3 hours!&lt;br  /&gt;&lt;br  /&gt;You have to be very careful about what is left running as well. I played for a while with Jaiku { &lt;a href=&quot;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://www.jaiku.com&quot;&quot;/ rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;http://www.jaiku.com&quot;&lt;/a&gt; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target =&quot;blank&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt; } and if you leave the client running it will kill the phone within 4 hours!&lt;br  /&gt;&lt;br  /&gt;You just have to learn to use the phone in a different way that any other handset I&#039;ve ever owned.&lt;br  /&gt;&lt;br  /&gt;Matt&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;How are you finding the N95?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br  /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br  /&gt;The better battery life comment intrigues me. My current phone is dying, but I&#039;m holding out for the E90.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br  /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br  /&gt;The N95 would also be fine for me, apart from reports of poor battery life - if the improvement is a significant one, then I may get an N95 yet!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br  /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

<p>The better battery life comment intrigues me. My current phone is dying, but I&#8217;m holding out for the E90.</p>
<p>The N95 would also be fine for me, apart from reports of poor battery life &#8211; if the improvement is a significant one, then I may get an N95 yet!</p>
