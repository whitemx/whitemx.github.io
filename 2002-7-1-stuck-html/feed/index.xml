					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Hi Matt - saw your brother at the weekend - Sally and I had a lovely relaxing time in Lowdham - the Whites certainly know how to &#039;chill out&#039;. Anyway, he mentioned your website so I thought I&#039;d have a look - great stuff. Hope you are well and prospering - I&#039;m still at Sport England but recently promoted to Senior Development Manager - enjoying myself. There are a lot of redundancies etc. happening here, but I&#039;m safe in my job I think! Hopefully see you soon. Kieran&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>
