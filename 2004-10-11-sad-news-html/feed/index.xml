					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;In McCarthy&#039;s bar he described many of the places I knew in my childhood visits to Ireland and I could &quot;hear&quot; the conversations!!  He also had the same feeling of belonging there even though he had been brought up in England.  We attended a reading of his at the local Wolsey Theatre and he was also a good performer - he autographed Dad&#039;s copy of the Road to McCarthy.  A sad loss so young.&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>
