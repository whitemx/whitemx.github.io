					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t know who these guys are but I don&#039;t like their methods so have blocked any reference to them in my referers list. I suggest other people do the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When they first appeared I had to register on their website to find out more and I assume they have sold that address, but it was a spam one which I use anyway so can&#039;t prove that.&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I found this site because I was looking up &quot;devaddict&quot; in a search engine.  Recently three people with that brand plus .com in their email addresses subscribed to a Yahoo! Group mailing list that I moderate.  I thought it a bit suspicious and wondered if it was some sort of spamming racket.  Have you any advice to offer about this?  Should these email subscribers be booted?  Are they likely to be collating other group members&#039; email addresses when they post to the group?&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I believe it also increases their Google PageRank enormously. I think that is the main reason it is done, not to get people to click from the blogs to their sites.&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>
