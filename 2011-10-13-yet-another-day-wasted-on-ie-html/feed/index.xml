					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Matt,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I thought I saw a blog about this problem I believe about a year or two ago.  However, I can&#039;t remember how the other person resolved it or whether he did.&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;thanks for the share.&lt;br/&gt;Absolutely agree with you, i always got no problems with FF, Chrome, Safari, and Opera, since they behave very similar.. The one who dances out of the row is always IE.. &lt;br/&gt;Got less problems in XPages webapps tough, but the generated html sourcecode of XPages is still kinda &#034;stability over beauty&#034; like, which is absolutely fine for webapps.. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;regards,&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Just a hunch. Was it happening with IE 8 both in compatibility mode and not? I know to my cost that IE 8 compatibility mode ignores float, as a result of which I had to force IE 8 to ignore compatibllity mode for one of my apps, to ensure it looked like it was designed to.&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>
