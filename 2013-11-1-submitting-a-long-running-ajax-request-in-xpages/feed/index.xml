					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I haven&#039;t had a chance to really investigate it yet, but I&#039;ve wanted to try web workers for this sort of scenario. From my very limited understanding it&#039;s like a separate thread that goes off and does it&#039;s own thing while the rest of the site continues to work and be functional without having to wait for the request to finish. Dunno if it&#039;s feasible or actually fits this scenario but might be worth investigating.&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>
