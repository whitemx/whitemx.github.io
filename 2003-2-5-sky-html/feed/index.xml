					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Hi Matthew - glad to hear that your short hop over the date line went well! I&#039;ve been a busy media-bee this week - I had a 1,500 word article on defamation and the Internet published in Insurance Day and have today had a  by-line and article in the Society for Computers and Law web journal on e-commerce regulatory compliance: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scl.org/services/default.asp?t=nw&#038;p=134&#038;c=-9999&#038;cID=1200000106&#038;ctID=10&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;http://www.scl.org/services/default.asp?t=nw&amp;p=134&amp;c=-9999&amp;cID=1200000106&amp;ctID=10&lt;/a&gt; It has been dead sunny here today and life is generally good! Enjoy this stage of your trip!&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>
