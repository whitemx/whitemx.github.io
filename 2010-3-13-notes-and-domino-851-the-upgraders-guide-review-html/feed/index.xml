					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Ulrich,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of my efforts are devoted to &lt;a href=&quot;http://xpages101.net&quot;/ rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;xpages101&lt;/a&gt; at the moment. And it wouldn&#039;t surprise me if there were better qualified people than already writing a book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Too many things to do, too little time. :-)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matt&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>
