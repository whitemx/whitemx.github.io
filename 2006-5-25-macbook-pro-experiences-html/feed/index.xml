					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;@Patrick,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See my comments above in @2, but I do agree with you, when the virtualisation software matches my requirements I&#039;ll be junking the Windows partition. My big hope is for OS X 1.5 (Leopard) which sound slike it will do exactly what I&#039;m after. Until then I boot into Windows in the morning, use that during the day and then for evenings and weekends (when I do my own work) I use OS X and Parallels where necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until we get the Hannover based Domino Designer client I am really tied to using Windows for my day job unfortunately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matt&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t see the benefit doing a dual boot.  I think virtualization is going to be more powerful.  Parallels is able to run VMWARE images as well as Virtual PC/Server.  VMWare is approximately $200 and when a product costing  about $40 is compatible, I think that is a good deal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Virtualization seems to be more appealing when you have the right hardware.  Knowing how efficient the MacBook Pro is running Virtualization seems to be a perfect match and I am not giving up disk space or inhibit from access files in the Mac or the guest environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cheers..&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Re Leopard, that&#039;s what I understand too... Boot Camp is a simply a beta preview of the core technology they intend to use in Leopard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In retrospect, it makes sense for Apple to do this, given that once upon a time, MS controlled the only other viable solution for all this (i.e. Virtual PC).&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I do have the pre release candidate for Parallels, it&#039;s really just Virtual PC on steroids and very useful if you just want to try something quickly or are forced to use IE for a website. But having played with it for a few hours there are a few niggles (mainly to do with the speed of the UI) which would annoy me if I had to use it for a full working week. Of course it&#039;s still beta software as well so it may well improve but at the moment the rebooting across into Windows suits me fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I understand the rumours coming out about Leopard then you&#039;ll be able to run both OS&#039;s at the same time without the need for rebooting which sounds just superb.&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>
