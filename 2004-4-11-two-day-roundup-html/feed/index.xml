					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Sounds like you had a nice time with Si &amp; Fi, Do you remember the Simpson episode where Homer takes a job in the Bowling Ally, and he keeps putting his head the bowl shiner? the picture kind of reminds me of that from the glare on your head, only kidding. You missed some yet more qualitiy meals from Mum, like Beaf Wellington! Matt &amp; I have had a busy easter looking after pets for Matt&#039;s dad again, which we love doing and visiting family locally. Matt &amp; I are currently organising a holiday of camping at Reedham, Norfolk Broads, and next to the camp site is a 17th Century Inn that does Real Ales and fab food!! We&#039;ll let you know how it goes but it looks nice on the website www.arhcerstouringpark.co.uk, if your into camping, walking, fishing, drinking and much more like Matt &amp; I are!&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>
