					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Matt,&lt;br  /&gt;   I&#039;ve been a contractor in Spain for 3 years and things don&#039;t work exactly the same here. I work mainly for consulting companies because the final customer, never ever uses contractors directly. So there&#039;s a tiny market for contractors in Spain, quite different from English one.&lt;br  /&gt;   On the other hand, dealing with final customers lets you detect necesities and projects that could improve substantially their bussiness processes. That fits more with a consulting role than with a developing one.&lt;br  /&gt;    Becoming a consultant means you are a company now. Congratulations for your decission and good luck. You&#039;ve got enough experience and good Lotus software produtcs to be succesful. Being brave is the best way to go ahead !  &lt;img alt=&quot;Emoticon&quot; src=&quot;&lt;a  rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;http://www.11tmr.com/11tmr.nsf/emoticons/DLYH-5N3GJG/$File/cheesy.gif&quot;&lt;/a&gt; /&gt; &lt;br  /&gt;&lt;br  /&gt;   Miguel Calvo&lt;br  /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>
