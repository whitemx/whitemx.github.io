					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I am glad you are starting an xPages project.  I have been working on one for about 2 months now and have found the answers to most things I have needed.  Sorry, I don&#039;t have an answer to your issue.  I did read something about dojo pulling it out of the form.  I also read that IBM was working on getting this changed, but I am sure that will be down the road.  If you have any other questions let me know and I will see what I can do to help you.&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>
