					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ve changed the color schemes in both Sublime and Terminal to use a dark background because I find that easier on my eyes. As a side effect those windows are a lot easier to spot on your desktop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides that:&lt;br /&gt;- dual monitors&lt;br /&gt;- live reload&lt;br /&gt;- using nodemon so you don&#039;t have to be in the terminal that much&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Two monitors .. &lt;br /&gt;Monitor 1 - wide-screen, holds the browsers&lt;br /&gt;Monitor 2 - tall(ish)-screen, holds the designer client&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Browser&#039;s debugging window doesn&#039;t have a &#034;home&#034; monitor - it switches depending on what&#039;s being done. If debugging, takes the designer client monitor, if updating code, takes the browser monitor ... I guess I need four monitors ;-) (third for debugging, fourth for non-development work).&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;For me I have 2 monitors - 1 monitor has Chrome running full screen - IDE goes on the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Webstorm has a built in terminal for running node.js so its contained within the IDE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course live reload of the browser means I never have to actually refresh the page which is handy.&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>
