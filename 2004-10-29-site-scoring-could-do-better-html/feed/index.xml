					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;There are some very useful guidelines approved by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and supported by thr Royal National Institute for the Blind (RNIB) which suggest very basic and helpful ideas to make websiteis accesible for everyone.  The rules under Part 3 of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (which came into force on 1 October 2004) only provide that owners of websites make &#039;reasonable adjustments&#039; to those sites to ensure that they are accesible to those who are are disabled.  There are, of course, limitations and exceptions to this, but the premise is that website owners are missing out (as are the relevant users)where those who are are disabled cannot access them.  I have an interesting case law report written by my fair self (published in the almost unread &#039;E-commerce Law Reports&#039; here in the UK) of the first prosecution brought under similar laws in Australia.  &lt;/p&gt;]]></description>
