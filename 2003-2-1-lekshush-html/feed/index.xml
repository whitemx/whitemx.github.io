					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Hi Matt this is your wake up call! we just had a really nice sunday roast ha-ha!! but you did miss out on all that washing up! Sounds like your having a good time and starting to relax. You must be in heaven with all those G &amp;G&#039;s ( Gadgets &amp; Geeks) sorry people but it&#039;s true. By the way Ipswich lost to 2-0 to Bradford &amp; Herman got sent off for elbowing someone in the face.
