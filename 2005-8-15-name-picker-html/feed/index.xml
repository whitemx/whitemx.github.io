<p>I have reworked it into a single design element, and added several new features including:</p>
<p>&#8211; Support for single categories<br />&#8211; Support for multiple return values into differing fields<br />&#8211; Triggering onchange events on the underyling form</p>
<p>I want to give something back to the Notes community which has given me so much, so I have posted this on my (still nacent) blog in the post { <a href="<a rel="nofollow" href="http://alpha.jenkinsmd.com/archive/2008/04/22/10.aspx"" rel="nofollow ugc"></a><a href="http://alpha.jenkinsmd.com/archive/2008/04/22/10.aspx" rel="nofollow ugc">http://alpha.jenkinsmd.com/archive/2008/04/22/10.aspx</a>&#8220; rel=&#8221;nofollow&#8221; target =&#8221;blank&#8221;>Link }</p>
<p>I hope everyone will take a look, help me identify any bugs, and give me feedback for improving it.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I discovered the problem with Netscape 7.  Actually, the first problem I asked about (window.opener.document.getElementById not returning an object) wasn&#039;t a problem per se.  It seems Netscape 7 needs the id parameter (instead of name) to be used in order for the getElementById method to work.  I changed name to id and both IE and Netscape were happy.  The next problem I ran into was getting the value to appear in the text field.  Initially, I thought Netscape wasn&#039;t returning anything(sounds like Matt White was having a similar problem).  Then I discovered that it was returning the desired value preceeded by spaces(Matt try pressing the down arrow to scroll the text to the top...I knew something was there because I returned the value in an alert popup).  It turns out there is a little bug in the way Netscape handles the unescape function (unfortunately, it took me a couple of days to figure this out...decodeURI offered the same results).  It took me a couple of days but I have it working now.  &lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;The name picker is a wonderful tool.  The multi-name picker seems to work in both IE and Netscape 7.  However, I can&#039;t get the single name picker to work in Netscape 7.  It appears that the window.opener.document.getElementById function is not returning the object in Netscape.  Of course, it works fine in IE.  Any ideas?&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>
