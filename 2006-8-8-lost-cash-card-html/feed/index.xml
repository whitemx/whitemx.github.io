					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;US banking varies wildly from state-to-state in my experience. My main bank in Indiana could give me a card and PIN there and then. The affiliate branch in Tampa could do nothing of the sort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whereas in the UK, &lt;b&gt;all&lt;/b&gt; banks are crap &lt;img src=&quot;&lt;a  rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;http://www.11tmr.com/11tmr.nsf/emoticons/DLYH-5MZVLY/$FILE/smile.gif&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&gt; See, we&#039;re consistent.&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t know what bank Sean deals with.  The bank I deal with here in the US would need to send me a new card from one location and a new PIN code from another location.  And for the duration not only would I not be able to use the ATM machines for cash, but I also would not be able to use the bank&#039;s web access for my account either, since it uses the ATM card number.  Five business days sounds about right.  Although admittedly, I haven&#039;t been through this for a few years.  &lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;The scary thing is that apparently I am a &quot;premier&quot; customer, normal mortals wouldn&#039;t get their card for an even longer period!&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;This is the difference between the British and American way of doing business.  If I lose my card, I can walk into my bank branch and walk out with a new card.  Or I can call the 24x7 help line and have one sent to my over night, without any additional cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sean---&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>
