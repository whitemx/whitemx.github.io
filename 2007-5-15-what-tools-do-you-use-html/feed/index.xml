					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&#039;d add wink to the list for creating tutorials and SnagIt for screenshots.&lt;br  /&gt;I have been working with both, MartinScott Noteman and Ytria scanEZ and must say i prefer scanEZ (no issues with both). The Ytria tools have a much cleaner UI and more features (plus other tools like signEZ etc).&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Yea, I had a few issues with Ytria as well.  Switched to the MartinScott tool a few years back and have not had any trouble with it.  I use it daily.  Real time saver.&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I would concur with your list, pretty much. I used XMLSpy for a while, but to be honest, it&#039;s too full-featured for me, got in the way.&lt;br  /&gt;&lt;br  /&gt;+1 for TextPad: love it. With regards a general purpose web-oriented editor on the Mac, the new love of my life is Coda. Lovely bit of kit that, very productive!&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>
