					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;As far as I can tell, my problem stems from BT Broadband themselves and is a fault in their systems rather than a cap being put on me. Of course they won&#039;t admit that but in the absence of any other likely explanations that&#039;s what I&#039;m going with.&lt;br  /&gt;&lt;br  /&gt;It seems very likely that BT have the technical capability to cap individual lines but whether they&#039;d go as far as capping someone who moves off them? Well I&#039;m not a big fan of conspiracy theories, and from what I&#039;ve seen of BT&#039;s internal workings over the last couple of weeks I severely doubt they have the organisational ability to do that sort of thing!&lt;br  /&gt;&lt;br  /&gt;Matt&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;The only problem with changing the supplier is that if the exchange still belongs to BT they &quot;appear&quot; to be able to cap individual lines. This is just from reading some of the comments to that post I mentioned in @5. I don&#039;t know if this is actually happening but - if it is - the regulator should come down on them hard. Rob.&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;It is rather depressing Rob isn&#039;t it. I got suckered into the year long contract and to be honest was quite happy until this slow speed issue kicked in. I have to wait until 15th May to change suppliers although last night the speed had gone up to 1.5mb which is better but nowhere near my old 5.5mb.&lt;br  /&gt;&lt;br  /&gt;I think it will be worth a move anyway in May, a friend has recommended { &lt;a href=&quot;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://www.eclipse.net.uk/&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;http://www.eclipse.net.uk/&quot;&lt;/a&gt; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target =&quot;blank&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt; } who seem to have an admirably clear usage policy, even if they are not the cheapest.&lt;br  /&gt;&lt;br  /&gt;Matt&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Take a look at this old post regarding slow broadband speeds from BT:&lt;br  /&gt;&lt;br  /&gt;{ &lt;a href=&quot;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://interactive.pcw.co.uk/2006/02/slow_broadband_.html&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;http://interactive.pcw.co.uk/2006/02/slow_broadband_.html&quot;&lt;/a&gt; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target =&quot;blank&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt; }&lt;br  /&gt;&lt;br  /&gt;or don&#039;t.  It is quite depressing.&lt;br  /&gt;&lt;br  /&gt;I was offered an upgrade from 2MB to &quot;up to 8&quot; MB by BT with an indication that I could get 6MB, oh and a £2/month reduction.  But after reading that post I might just pay the additional £2 because I&#039;m not tied in for an additional year (and I get 20GB per month not 6GB which is what they are moving to now).&lt;br  /&gt;&lt;br  /&gt;Good luck with your problem.  I hope you manage to sort it.

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;And I had worst problem ever. Modem disconnects for every several minutes. And you can&#039;t do anything. This is happening for the month already. So your tech support is the best comparing to mine&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;You have my sympathy. I had similar problems a year ago. Because I lived in India for six years, I have no trouble understanding the Indians. However, these call centres work to scripts and they are so frustrating because they take you through all the things that you would have done already (such as rebooting the router). I dread having to use these so called help desks.
