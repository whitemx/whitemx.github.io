					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I know exactly what you mean Matthew. We had a real problem with season 1 being on Sunday evenings as we always ended the weekend going to bed stressed. I&#039;m afriad it put me off season 2. I suggest you watch the Girl Next Door at the cinema as this will give you a completely different view of annoying old Kim Bauer, and the Lost Boys might do the same job for Kiefer&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>
