					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Of course Linux would be a more sensible option for running the Domino server, its requirements are far less hardware wise. But I simply don&#039;t have any skills with Linux, if and when I get time to learn how to install and manage a server then I probably will switch but until then this setup seems to be running OK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe I overstated the media centre side of things, I don&#039;t use it all the time and after a little bit of monitoring the processor doesn&#039;t really go above 50% usage which is not a serious issue at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other thing I will be monitoring is VMWare for OS X which I guess will be more suited to my requirements than Parallels. Hopefully that will be out in the next few months.&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>
