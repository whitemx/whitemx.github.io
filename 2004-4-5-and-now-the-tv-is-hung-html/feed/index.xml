					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;One day Matt &amp; I will have one but we&#039;ll probably be in our 50&#039;s or something, I could imagine a tv on our wall in our small home, witha round the corner sofa, City Gardener started again last night, I completly recommend watching it, he&#039;s very good and doesn&#039;t even own a garden himeself! Matt &amp; I have been recently been planting with Mum&#039;s help in our back car park area and it&#039;s starting to look like more than nettles and junk, it looks green &amp; soon will look flowery too!! I think an evening to test your Tv is called for Matthew!&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Sounds very relaxing. I&#039;m only surprised you haven&#039;t had one of the these TVs before! Just hope that your brother doesn&#039;t start wanting one now!&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>
