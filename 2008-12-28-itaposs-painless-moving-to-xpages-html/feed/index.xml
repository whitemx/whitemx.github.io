					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ll just hold off for gold code and go through my list and see what&#039;s still broken, then we can compare notes.  &lt;img alt=&quot;Emoticon&quot; src=&quot;&lt;a  rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;http://www.11tmr.com/11tmr.nsf/emoticons/DLYH-5MZVLY/$File/smile.gif&quot;&lt;/a&gt; /&gt;  Thanks for the offer.&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;@12 Charles, I don&#039;t have anything documented I&#039;m afraid and I suspect that it would be a bit of a waste of time at the moment with the impending release of 8.5.0. I certainly have three or four things to check but other than those I haven&#039;t got any serious bugs open at the moment.&lt;br  /&gt;&lt;br  /&gt;Ping me on BleedYellow if you want some details.&lt;br  /&gt;&lt;br  /&gt;Matt&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Matt, do you have any reference for &quot;here&#039;s the broken bits&quot; that you could share?  Things like field names in subforms on XPages not showing up in dropdown lists, etc?  I&#039;ve been reading the 8.5 Beta forum to try to keep up with what&#039;s known to be broken, what will be fixed in a future release, and what&#039;s just beta weird behavior.&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Thanks, Matt and Tim, for the explanation. It&#039;s kind of what the Websphere guys told us all the time, right? &lt;img alt=&quot;Emoticon&quot; src=&quot;&lt;a  rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;http://www.11tmr.com/11tmr.nsf/emoticons/DLYH-5MZVLY/$File/smile.gif&quot;&lt;/a&gt; /&gt;&lt;br  /&gt;&lt;br  /&gt;In understand you still have to maintain the Classic code, so you are not saving work, but have more scalability.&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;@8 - Spot on Tim, plus we get some other performance improvements to do with the computation of whether the user has voted on each idea which just add to the benefits of XPages.&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;@Volker, I&#039;m not privy to their codebase, but I&#039;m assuming (based on the work I&#039;ve been doing on Lotus 911 XPage projects) that the bulk of (if not all of) what used to be in agents now runs in server-side JavaScript, which really just means it&#039;s JS being interpreted as Java within a servlet engine, so not only is there less overhead because the servlet is resident the whole time (as opposed to instantiating an agent for each equivalent transaction), but the server can also cache objects that would otherwise have to be re-instantiated for every agent run. Hence, all users can share memory pointers to application settings, etc., which also reduces the amount of database queries.&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;@5 - Yes there are certainly less agents, we are also able to send smaller web pages out to the browser.
