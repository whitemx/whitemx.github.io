					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I hope the Gold release has dramatic improvement in the Composite App dev tools.  As it is, they&#039;re pretty lame.  And debugging them?  Good luck with that.   Maybe if it really was as simple as &quot;wiring&quot; things together, our issues would be moot.  But in my experience, as with yours, even the examples they published don&#039;t work reliably.  And FSM help you if you try to build one from scratch... &lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Good to hear I&#039;m not alone. I was deliberately trying not to slag off the beta as I am quite aware that it&#039;s not complete. We&#039;ll see later this month I guess.&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Your experience isn&#039;t so different from mine, and I&#039;m running a fairly recent install of Windows XP SP2.  I&#039;m going to wait until the gold release before I complain about it too much.  I&#039;ve been kneecapped one time too many for daring to comment on the state of Notes 8 beta.  &lt;img alt=&quot;Emoticon&quot; src=&quot;&lt;a  rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;http://www.11tmr.com/11tmr.nsf/emoticons/DLYH-5N3GL7/$File/undecided.gif&quot;&lt;/a&gt; /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;]]></description>
