					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;@Eric and @Matthew - you may want to do a Google for Hackintosh on VMWare and be pleasantly surprised ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@Matthew - with regards to Windows 7, it&#039;s a huge leap forwards from XP, runs absolutely fine in a VM and is much more OS X like. THough I won&#039;t be switching back to MS any time soon, it is a much more pleasant place to be.&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the tip, Matt. Now, If could only find a way to have a MAC OS in a VM so I can test stuff... I&#039;m willing to buy the MAC OS, and I&#039;ve seen people blog how but it still seems scary and more complex than just buying a Mac - which I;m not ready to do at this time.&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>
