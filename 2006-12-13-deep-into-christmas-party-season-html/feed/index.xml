					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Yes we&#039;re emailing you on holiday, the weather here has been nice and we&#039;ve done loads from Epcot, Universal (both parks), Discovery Cove (totally recommend it just fantastic) and Animal Kindom, along with seeing Orlando Magic Basketball we both loved it......GO MAGIC, and The Florida Seals Ice Hockey Team and we&#039;re seeing the Dolly Parton Dixie Stampede tonight YEHAH.  Of course the typical loads of shopping and winning teddies in the parks so luggage comeing back has increased. The villa has been top notch and it&#039;s been a good holiday I think we all need a vacation to recover from this one though. One tip never try catering for 10 people you hardly know, how do you do it mum?! The holibobs was much needed and we&#039;re not looking forward to the cold UK, happy holidays everyone see yall real soon. &lt;img src=&quot;&lt;a  rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;http://www.11tmr.com/11tmr.nsf/emoticons/DLYH-5MZVLS/$FILE/biggrin.gif&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;]]></description>
