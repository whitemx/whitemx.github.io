					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;As I&#039;m sure you are aware, you can do this with Excel as well.  Just make the content a table and the table cells become the cells in the spreadsheet.  It&#039;s a bit of a hack, but works, if you don&#039;t need too much control of the output formatting.&lt;br  /&gt;&lt;br  /&gt;I&#039;ve been thinking about playing with some ODF stuff for my doc gen stuff, should be very powerful.&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>
