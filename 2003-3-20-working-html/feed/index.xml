					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;The real question is whether having children is felt to be a selfish act or one for the greater good. If it&#039;s the first then it&#039;s only fair that there is a loss to the individual who makes that choice. If, on the other hand, you see having children and being able to work in a way that makes family life more stable as a social good then it is fair that the burden is shared out more equally. I&#039;m not commenting either way, just noting that there are two points of view.&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;my comments were largely directed at men getting these extra rights, i accept that things are different for women but even so to expect equal rights at work surely you can&#039;t then request special treatment for yourself?&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;You are dooming women to having second class careers - I have only been able to pick up my own professional life once you were all old enough - think what I could have done in the profession if I had been in it all the time! (Chair of College/lecturing etc) People do have to make choices, but as women are now 50% of the work force, have the children and are reported still to do most of the childcare and household tasks, some flexible hours are called for. I understand the gripe about doing other peoples&#039; jobs - do you have an answer?&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>
