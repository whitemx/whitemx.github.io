					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;This really is a great solution for people and city mobility problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br  /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br  /&gt;The company I work for has been developing projects around this concept since 99 when they started a project in University of California. In the first few projects electric cars were used and now in cities like Singapore hybrids are been used. In Singapore you can check the car availability by SMS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br  /&gt;I hope they bring this to Europe soon.&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Welcome fellow tree hugger &lt;img alt=&quot;Emoticon&quot; src=&quot;&lt;a  rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;http://www.11tmr.com/11tmr.nsf/emoticons/DLYH-5MZVLS/$File/biggrin.gif&quot;&lt;/a&gt; /&gt;&lt;br  /&gt;&lt;br  /&gt;Our transit-accessible, two-driver, one-car household in Washington DC has been relying on services similar to StreetCar for a number of years.  In particular I like ZipCar the best, and blogged about it a while ago: { &lt;a href=&quot;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://www.lotusguru.com/lotusguru/LGBlog.nsf/SearchResults?OpenNavigator&#038;Query=zipcar&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;http://www.lotusguru.com/lotusguru/LGBlog.nsf/SearchResults?OpenNavigator&#038;Query=zipcar&quot;&lt;/a&gt; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target =&quot;blank&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt; }&lt;br  /&gt;&lt;br  /&gt;One thing to keep in mind is that even if you don&#039;t have a car near your home, if your final destination is on the the other side of town, you can also take transit to the nearest tube stop that has a Streetcar and pick it up from there.&lt;br  /&gt;&lt;br  /&gt;Fun stuff.&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome fellow tree hugger <img alt="Emoticon" src="<a  rel="nofollow ugc"/><a href="http://www.11tmr.com/11tmr.nsf/emoticons/DLYH-5MZVLS/$File/biggrin.gif" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.11tmr.com/11tmr.nsf/emoticons/DLYH-5MZVLS/$File/biggrin.gif</a>&#8220; /></p>
<p>Our transit-accessible, two-driver, one-car household in Washington DC has been relying on services similar to StreetCar for a number of years.  In particular I like ZipCar the best, and blogged about it a while ago: { <a href="<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.lotusguru.com/lotusguru/LGBlog.nsf/SearchResults?OpenNavigator&amp;Query=zipcar"" rel="nofollow ugc"></a><a href="http://www.lotusguru.com/lotusguru/LGBlog.nsf/SearchResults?OpenNavigator&#038;Query=zipcar" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.lotusguru.com/lotusguru/LGBlog.nsf/SearchResults?OpenNavigator&#038;Query=zipcar</a>&#8220; rel=&#8221;nofollow&#8221; target =&#8221;blank&#8221;>Link }</p>
<p>One thing to keep in mind is that even if you don&#8217;t have a car near your home, if your final destination is on the the other side of town, you can also take transit to the nearest tube stop that has a Streetcar and pick it up from there.</p>
<p>Fun stuff.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Very slightly, possibly, maybe interested.
