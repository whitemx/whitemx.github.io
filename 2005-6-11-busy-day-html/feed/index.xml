					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Hi Matthew, &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I understand what you mean about the regularity of posting. I started to do a maternity diary (in very old fashioned hand written form) when I started maternity leave four weeks ago but and beginning to find that I&#039;ve put down a lot of what I wanted to say. Obviously things will start moving again in the next few weeks but at the moment I&#039;m just plodding along and I&#039;m not sure it&#039;s that interesting for me - or anyone who wanted to read it in the future - to do detailed entries every day. We shall see how dedicated I can be. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Best of luck with the moving by the way. I&#039;m sure you will handle it in your normal calm and organised manner!&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>
