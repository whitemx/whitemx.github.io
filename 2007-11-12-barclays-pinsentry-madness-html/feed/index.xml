					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;The old system was vunerable to phishing and key logging software which not all anti-virus software detects and if  passwords etc are logged over a long enough period it is possible to work out the login details&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t mind the PINsentry reader. Working in Lloyds security department I&#039;ve seen a lot of fraud and the internet is the most common one. &lt;br  /&gt;Its not just phishing scams that can con a customer, a very silent trojan can transmit small packets of data to its owner which is enough for someone to learn your password, and user ID&#039;s. &lt;br  /&gt;The Pinsentry has dropped internet banking fraud by nearly 100%! Which is very impressive. And its not that inconvenient really, just a few more seconds to log on/transfer...a small price to pay for the benefits.&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;i have just got one of these pin sentrys today and yes they can be way more insecure and are open for fraud i have not had much time to play with it but i know you can use any card in them you only get 3 attemps but you can still see if the pin works i tried my nat west card and it accepted my pin and gave me a code back so i`m thinking if you can get the software off of it and remove the 3 pin try limit you could brute force stolen card pin numbers all day long a 4 digit pin wont take long when a cheap pc can attempt millions a second. its only a matter of time before this all goes tits up&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Burglar breaks in, finds PINsentry, forces the PIN from me in the privacy of my own home (the device kindly tells him if I am telling the truth), Barclays responsible for loss, I am the one who is physically threatened.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br  /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br  /&gt;I am now with Halifax.&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Hi all, I&#039;ve been following this thread and I especially liked Eddy&#039;s opinion : &quot;Can’t wait until some smart ass hacks into this stupid thing making thier whole expensive new venture completely futile.&quot; - This may sound like a joke but I think devices similar to PIN Sentry readers are already being developed by relevant mafia organizations, they look and work the same and the only difference is that they have a mobile device built in that forwards your PIN number as you enter it along with all the data stored on your card&#039;s magnetic bar, give it some time, lets see what Barclays is to say about that. Oh, hang on... I think I know what they&#039;ll say : &quot;You should never ever use 3rd party devices unless they are approved by Barclays&quot; - excellent, what if I was sent one by post in a letter that would seem to originate from Barclays&#039; encouraging me to replace my current device with a new one for security reasons ?   LOL. &lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Did anybody else experience problems late last week with logging onto Barclays personal accounts...my virus scanner picked up Trojan-spy.hyml.fruad.gen within the sites code, maybe within an image on the site, messages got posted online, but got deleted rapidly. they denied it, blamed my pc, but later in the day my scanner informed me the site was safe again!!!&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I hate my PINsentry so much I emailed Barclays to ask if there was an alternative as i was thinking of switching accounts. It took them 3 weeks to respond, by which time I had opened a new online-only current account (Coventry BS 6%+ APR!). Interestingly, Barclays sais it is optional - if you don&#039;t like it you can go back to the old ways but certain transactions (e.g. setting up a new payee) have to go through the call centre.&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;@17 - Kerr, it seems like a genuine, if fairly badly informed, comment. I&#039;ll leave for the moment.&lt;br  /&gt;&lt;br  /&gt;@16 - As far as I know the liability of losses from online banking have not transferred to the customer so the risk is not with me but with Barclays if my account gets hacked. As for the 2 letters guessing comment, you get three goes at guessing two letters from what is, for me, a complex random password. I am quite happy with the old system&#039;s compromise of security and usability. The new Pinsentry system is skewed too far towards the impression of security in my view.&lt;br  /&gt;&lt;br  /&gt;That being said, my approach of pre-generating the keys for logging in seems to work OK for me, it is just hugely less secure than the old system.&lt;br  /&gt;&lt;br  /&gt;Matt&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>
