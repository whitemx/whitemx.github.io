					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;photos look excellent. Good to hear that everyone&#039;s well. We&#039;re in the mountains north of Jo&#039;berg until tomorrow evening - then back to the cold on Wednesday morning! Safari was amazing - we saw 4 of the &#039;big 5&#039; - elephant, lion, buffalo, rhino - but no leopard. All terribly refined with aircon, minibar etc in each mud hut. Love to all.&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>
