										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://qtzar.com/">Declan&#8217;s</a> Forum Friday idea happened to coincide with me coming across what is seemingly a bug in Domino which has been around for a long time. So back in 2006 the following question was <a href="http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/nd6forum.nsf/55c38d716d632d9b8525689b005ba1c0/e4e642944e3fec20852571850032e075?OpenDocument">asked on notes.net</a>:</p>
<p>&#8220;In the ACL, Anonymous is set to &#8220;No Access&#8221; with read and write to public document. Anonymous don&#8217;t have problem opening form, pages, image resource which have &#8220;Available to Public Access&#8221;.</p>
<p>But I face a problem with file resource. I&#8217;ve check on the &#8220;Availabel to Public Access&#8221; but it still prompt a login? How can I overcome this? &#8220;</p>
<p>I hadn&#8217;t come across this before, but doing some testing on the next version of <a href="http://ideajam.net/">Idea Jam</a> it bit me.</p>
<p>The file I was trying to get to was <a href="http://mootools.net/">Mootools</a>. The obvious answer was to move it into a script library, but because it&#8217;s a compressed file all on one line, Domino doesn&#8217;t serve it up correctly. So my rather dirty solution was to change the File Resource to be a Stylesheet Resource instead. The reason that this will work is that Stylesheet Resources don&#8217;t serve up a content type (whereas if you try to use an Image Resource it will tell the browser that it should expect a graphic which causes an error). So a quick and dirty solution but it does work at least. Now I wonder if we can get the bug fixed since that it seems to have been around since ND6.x.</p>
