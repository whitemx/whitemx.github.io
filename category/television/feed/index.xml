										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over here in the UK we have just had the last episodes of <a href="http://www.nbc.com/The_West_Wing/">The West Wing</a> over the weekend. I think everyone pretty much agrees that when Aaron Sorkin left the writing team (around season 4) that the quality began to drop and a long slow move towards soap story lines began. The 7th and final season was a minor improvement but I have to say I was really disappointed by the last episode.</p>
<p>There was such potential for a great and moving send off, by the time it was shot everyone already knew that the show had been cancelled so there was no need to worry about continuity into the next season. Instead we got a fairly bland inauguration day and uninteresting closure stories for all the characters bar CJ.</p>
<p>Even though I&#8217;m moaning I will definitely miss the show in the future, it was still one of the best things on television. Now we are left with only a few things that are actually worth watching&#8230; </p>
<p>My must watch list is now pretty short and includes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shield">The Shield</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_%28TV_series%29">24</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futurama">Futurama</a> (when it comes back) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_gear">Top Gear</a>. What else can people recommend?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There was a new programme on TV last night called <a href="http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/T/teachem3/index.html">That&#8217;ll Teach &#8216;Em</a>, a fairly standard reality show where 16 year olds are &#8220;sent back to a 1950&#8217;s education&#8221;. I was watching it and thinking how familiar the school looked and then I realised why&#8230; it&#8217;s set at my <a href="http://www.stjos.co.uk/">old school</a>. Very strange to see it on TV, especially in this context but it does fit the requirements very well with some of the old buildings (where I used to have my Geography lessons) near the chapel, where my sister got married, being used for the classes.</p>
