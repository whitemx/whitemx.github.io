					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Thanks Chris,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I already have a pretty good idea of where I going to head to, the Grand Canyon is definitely one of the places high up the list. Then it will be a zig-zag through Salt Lake City, Denver, Kansas, Chicago, Detroit, Pittsburgh and finally back to New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matt&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Well I have been through every state, so let me know if you have some specific sites you wish to see.  Definitely get to the Grand Canyon on your way out of LA.  From there the road is open to many options straight across, north and south.  Or even a zig-zag pattern.&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;It would be fair to say I&#039;m quite jealous. Everyone&#039;s going to NY at the mo, you&#039;re the third person in the next couple of months. Ah well, when baby is about 15 we might be able to go again!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have a lovely trip&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>
