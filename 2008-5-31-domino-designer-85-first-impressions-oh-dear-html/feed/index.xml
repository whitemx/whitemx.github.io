					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I downloaded 8.5 designer yesterday and edited some of the design elements of a database created years ago probably in 4.5 and updated since then in every version. There were no problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br  /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br  /&gt;I re-opened it today and I can not see the design elements any more. The software is still running fine(thousands are accessing it!) Where are my design elements? Am I missing a setting in the new notes designer?&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;@7 - Of course I recognized the efforts the Designer team made. Also the &quot;first results&quot; of porting to Eclipse are auspicious. This is definitely the way to go. But again (for me) my above (@6) mentioned features are most important. Do the fundamentals in 8.5 and give me XPages in 8.5.1 then I am beatific.&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Don&#039;t want to have 8.5 without updated LotusScript and Java editors. And PLEASE give me the possibility to fully debug Java code from inside Designer. It is so boring and time consuming to transfer and manage projects on both sides.&lt;br  /&gt;&lt;br  /&gt;Hey IBM please give the Designer team the resources they need to give us a modern IDE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;from @1:&lt;br  /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&#062;&#062;Unfortunately the new LotusScript editor wont make it for 8.5 but it&#039;s slated for 8.5.1 I think.&#060;&#060;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br  /&gt;Yeah, well, pardon me for not believing it until it ships.  Something always comes along to bump the class browser down the priority list.  Unless I&#039;m completely imagining things, it was supposed to be part of Designer 7 (mentioned at a Lotusphere a few years back as they &quot;heard&quot; us).  Yeah, well, that didn&#039;t happen.  Should have been a natural for DDE...but of course management has other priorities.  Why would that change once 8.5 ships?  The Designer development team can do it, if only given the time and resources by management.  The problem is clearly management, and that doesn&#039;t change when 8.5 ships...&lt;br  /&gt;&lt;br  /&gt;In my view, updating the LotusScript editor is easily important enough that ND8.5 should be held until it&#039;s completed.  Besides, that&#039;s quite possibly the only way to ensure it ever gets added to Designer.&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Our developers were looking for that new Eclipse Designer.Will they be disapointed also. SURE. IBM used to compare their clear Road Map against Microsoft&#039;s one.&lt;br  /&gt;&lt;br  /&gt;Not so clear anymore! BTW, since people don&#039;t get involve with Lotus Notes at school, and that Lotus Notes is not only Java programming; what is the trend on Lotus Training Center in your area? &lt;br  /&gt;&lt;br  /&gt;Here in Quebec (Canada), the courses offering have been declining every year, over the 5 last years.&lt;br  /&gt;&lt;br  /&gt;Isn&#039;t that a clear sign about that Lotus UNCLEAR Road Map?&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;That&#039;s what I had heard as well. What I don&#039;t understand is why the release of 8.5 is not delayed until the editors are ready. They are key functionality that I would consider a show stopper if not present.&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>
