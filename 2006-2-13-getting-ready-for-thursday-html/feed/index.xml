					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ll admit it is fun, but don&#039;t you find that shooting fish in barrels can be a bit boring?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much better to completely blow them away by developing an application which would take months in .Net (or J2EE for that matter) in a couple of weeks, and not only that do it better than other platforms could.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my experience, whenever I&#039;ve been put into competition with .Net to produce the same application we&#039;ve always won. There&#039;s no need to get personal or defensive about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matt&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>
