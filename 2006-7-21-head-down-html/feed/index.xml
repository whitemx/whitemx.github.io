					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I think it firstly depends on the role. When I was working in a 100% development role I found the concept of the zone very advantageous, giving one a chance to get on with development work and avoiding the support and project office requests with a few peaceful and focused moments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As my role has drifted more towards a Business Analyst flavour, I am finding myself pulled into meetings more, and at the mercy of managers in a mad panic to obtain the latest documentation, the position of the project, or for some pretty graphs to impress another layer of management. So, no more peaceful moments !&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also, I think the existence and duration of the zone is dependent on the project, and where it&#039;s at. The migration project I am working on has been running for just over a year and a half, but has now reached a busy stage leading up to the conversion date. Development teams have less chances to stay in the zone as they now have to attend to bug fixing as well as finishing features that are behind schedule.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We have instigated 24 hour shifts to get through the work and simulate migration activities in real time. What we are finding is that this shift pattern also encourages a &quot;nightime&quot; zone, where much is acheived in the absence of managerial interruptions and ad-hoc MI requests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s not just you, I know what you mean. Like you, I have days when I actually *get stuff done* (they&#039;re becoming rare as I end doing more infrastructure-type stuff &lt;img src=&quot;&lt;a  rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;http://www.11tmr.com/11tmr.nsf/emoticons/DLYH-5N3GHL/$FILE/sad.gif&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&gt; ) I also have whole weeks that are really productive... I could do with one of those right now for the final push on DominoWiki!&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>
