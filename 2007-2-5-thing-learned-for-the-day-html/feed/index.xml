					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Actually, the sorting doesn&#039;t matter.  In fact, the only requirement is that the view you are deleting from exists.  The document doesn&#039;t even have to appear in the view.  In fact, it can be a folder which is even better since a view consumes some resources on the server to keep its index updated.  What I have done in the past is just setup a dedicated hidden folder called something like &quot;(Delete)&quot; and then, when you want to delete a doc you just call db/(delete)/unid?DeleteDocument.&lt;br  /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>
