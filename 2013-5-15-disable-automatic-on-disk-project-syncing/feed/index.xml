					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;This is useful also because I have run into the scenario where automatic syncing was checked, but was not actually syncing.  At least if I know it is off and I manually sync it, I won&#039;t ASSUME it is being synched (sunc?) when it isn&#039;t.  If that made any sense at all.&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;That&#039;s a great tip, but one gotcha to be aware of (I fell into it myself). If you open a database in Designer, deselecting these options means it doesn&#039;t automatically open the referenced on-disk project. This really threw me, because I was sure I had set up source control, but the Team Development context menu only gave options to set up source control or associate with an on-disk project. But I was sure I already had an on-disk project, but couldn&#039;t remember the name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I opened the relevant on-disk project, the Team Development (right-click) context menu gave the options I expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, not a huge pain because I can temporarily re-enable the settings if I really need to. But it threw me for a little while.&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>
