					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I think that the figures might have been mis-interpreted there. Doesn&#039;t it mean that 51.5% of babies born to couples living together are boys (therefore 48.5% are girls) and that 49.9% of babies born to couples not living together are boys (therefore 50.1% are girls)? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is significant only because it suggests that there are ways to influence the gender of your child and that, if families continue to change, we could end up with a lot more females than males in future. Small percentages over a long time in a big population add up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I might be wrong though!&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>
