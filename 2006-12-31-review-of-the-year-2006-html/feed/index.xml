					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;OK, this is odd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had assumed that the problem was caused because I&#039;m using Directory Assistance for the Defectr users (i.e. they&#039;re in a secondary NAB). I had been refreshing the views in that NAB, but I tried doing the same on the main NAB and it now seems to work. I&#039;ll post a proper explanation tomorrow, but thanks for the prompt Bill!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matt&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Hey Bill, thanks for that. I am doing the refresh but it&#039;s not taking effect for about 5 minutes. I always over-estimate the timings when talking to users to cater for unforeseen delays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matt&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;In terms of Defectr: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I created a new Team Member and they can&#039;t log in&lt;br/&gt;Currently it takes our servers a little time to catch up with new registrations, we are working on this but until then it can take up to 15 minutes for a new account to work. Why not use the time to appreciate the wonder of the world around you or to hug a colleague.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just refresh the names.nsf views..  Do a &quot;load updall names.nsf&quot; with a couple of views - which I cant remember offhand....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;---* Bill&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>
