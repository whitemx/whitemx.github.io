					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Thought you might like to hear this snippet of Helen&#039;s email - &quot;We are now in Dawson city. It is brilliant, just like  a film set. Population of around 1900 people, dirt roads, saloons, lots of country music. We went to a follie show last night and a casino. It was excellent. Went back to campsite at around 1.30am. Had to get a ferry!! It was still light!! Off to Tangle lakes tomorrow - another 400 miles!! Meeting with another trek group and having a salmon bake.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>
