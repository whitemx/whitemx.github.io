					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Great to see you mate, and thanks for helping to make this week a success on so many levels, both for me personally and for the show as a whole.&lt;br  /&gt;&lt;br  /&gt;You missed the Karaoke (or at least most of it) at the Geek Dinner.  I haven&#039;t laughed that hard in a LONG time.  And you missed me getting dragged up to sing (thanks Mr. Lepofsky!).  On second thought, maybe it was good you missed that &lt;img alt=&quot;Emoticon&quot; src=&quot;&lt;a  rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;http://www.11tmr.com/11tmr.nsf/emoticons/DLYH-5MZVLU/$File/wink.gif&quot;&lt;/a&gt; /&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>
