										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It seems like a long time since I went away on holiday, and it is. Since the middle of July I&#8217;ve been to <a href="http://www.latitudefestival.co.uk/">Latitude</a> (great), Madeira (great), <a href="http://iamlug.org/iamlug/IamLug2010.nsf">IamLUG</a> (great) and run an <a href="http://xpages101.net/">XPages101</a> day (seemed to go well). So all in all it&#8217;s been a really enjoyable few weeks.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sat in JFK airport in New York waiting to start the final leg of the journey home and much as it&#8217;s been a great couple of weeks away, I am *really* looking forward to getting back home and just decompressing for a couple of days before getting back into the real world with a vengeance on Monday morning.</p>
<p>IamLUG was a really superb event, <a href="http://idonotes.com/">Chris</a> and the rest of the team do put on a good show. Everything was run incredibly smoothly, the content was very good indeed and, as ever, the people were great company. I presented my &#8220;<a href="http://mattwhite.me/iamlug_tenpatterns.zip">Ten XPages Design Patterns</a>&#8221; session, probably for the last time as I&#8217;ve used it for a year now. So I need to start thinking about future sessions pretty seriously now. (Bet you can&#8217;t guess what I plan to speak about next time!).</p>
<p>After IamLUG, we had the inaugural &#8220;<a href="http://tackiton.com/">Tack It On</a>&#8221; day, and I&#8217;d really like to thank <a href="http://www.lotusnotebook.com/">David Leedy</a> for his invaluable assistance during the day. I had been rather lax and not given him a huge amount of guidance before the day itself but he dealt with all of the questions with good grace and humour. Things really wouldn&#8217;t have run as smoothly without him there. Overall I think the day went pretty well. I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;ll be more of these sorts of things happening in the future.</p>
