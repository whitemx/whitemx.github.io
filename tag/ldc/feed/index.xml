										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well Lotusphere has been over for a week now and people are just about recovering from the post LS flu and getting back into the swing of things. But did you miss out on getting an <a href="http://londondevelopercoop.com/">LDC</a> shirt. <a href="http://blog.woowar.com/">Julian</a>, <a href="http://stickfight.co.uk/">Mark</a> and I were only able to physically carry over a 150 or so shirts this year and we had to apologise to so many people for not having the design or size they wanted.</p>
<p>So we thought we&#8217;d try and rectify that by adding all of this year&#8217;s designs, along with previous t-shirts that we&#8217;ve given out at other conferences and allow you to buy your own. The most important thing to note is that this is not a money making exercise, anything which we make will be donated to the <a href="http://www.joyrx.org/">Children&#8217;s Cancer Association</a> who we have <a href="http://mattwhite.me/blog/2011/2/1/its-a-small-lotus-world-raffle-results.html">previously donated money raised by the Lotus community to</a>.</p>
<p>The store we use is called Zazzle and the link to the latest shirts is: <a href="http://www.zazzle.co.uk/londevcoop/?qs=&amp;dp=0&amp;pg=3#homeProducts">http://www.zazzle.co.uk/londevcoop/?qs=&amp;dp=0&amp;pg=3#homeProducts</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please feel to buy as many shirts or other products as you like, hopefully we can raise even more money for the CCA.</p>

Come find myself or one of the other LDC members or other sponsors for a sticker to get in. It is a free beer after all, so worth the effort!</p>
