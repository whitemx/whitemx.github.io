										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Next week I am running (with the able assistance of my <a href="http://londondevelopercoop.com/">LDC colleagues</a>) the first iteration of my new <a href="http://xpages101.net/">XPages101 course</a>. Interest has been gratifyingly high, but we do still have a very few places left. If you wanted to come along and either the news got lost in amongst all of the #LS10 craziness, or you&#8217;re worried about training costs generally, then I&#8217;d encourage you to check out the <a href="http://xpages101.net/">course page</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I designed the course to cover as much as possible in a day and the price to be low enough that independent consultants and contractors (my background) can afford to send themselves on it.</p>
<p>So I hope to see you in London next week. If you can&#8217;t make it during the day for some reason then we are also having a LotusBeer gathering in the evening of the 9th February at the <a href="http://www.foundersarms.co.uk/">Founders Arms</a> from around 6pm. You&#8217;re more than welcome to come along if you&#8217;re in the area.</p>
