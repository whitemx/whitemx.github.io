										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I will be teaching a brand new four day XPages course in Vienna next month. The first day will be covering the tried and tested XPages101 introduction to XPages class. But then for the next three days we&#8217;ll be covering a *lot* more content. Everything from Dojo to Server Side JavaScript, Java and Managed Beans.</p>
<p>If you come along to the course then I promise a couple of things. By the time you go home you&#8217;ll have a solid understanding of XPages. And your head will hurt as we&#8217;re going to cover a lot of ground!</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d like to come along, the sign up for the course can be found <a href="http://www.wifiwien.at/eShop/bbDetails.aspx/IBM-Lotus---Introduction-to-x-Pages--Workshop/@/bbnr/365521/zg/E9b2/">here</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I flew over from to Amsterdam from London this morning (easiest journey ever by the way, City airport shows that it is possible to have a vaguely pleasant travel experience still) to prepare for the <a href="http://www.clearitconsulting.nl/site/blog.nsf/dx/08-02-2010155139CDRKFG.htm">two day XPages course</a> which I&#8217;m helping to run with <a href="http://www.clearitconsulting.nl/">Clear IT Consulting</a> this week.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve not been to Amsterdam for about 18 months, and I suspect I won&#8217;t see much of the city this trip, but I do like it a lot over here.</p>
<p>This is continuing what is, for me at least, a busy month of travel with Belgium last week, a trip to Newcastle this weekend on which I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll hear more (although not maybe in the blogosphere), and then Denmark next week. It&#8217;s good to do travel some times and I&#8217;m lucky enough to be an infrequent enough flyer that it&#8217;s still a novelty for me. So I&#8217;m planted in the hotel this afternoon just continuing with my normal development work and then heading over the training room this evening to make sure everything is set up for tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>As <a href="http://benpoole.com/">Ben</a> says, &#8220;Ah the life of the jet setting freelancer&#8221;. Indeed.</p>
