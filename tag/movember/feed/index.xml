<p>Well the &#8216;tache growing is progressing as poorly as can be expected for someone so follically challenged as myself. But, remember this is all in a good cause. If you&#8217;ve not yet sponsored my continuing social embarrassment then there&#8217;s only ten days left to head over to the <a href="http://uk.movember.com/mospace/294156">Movember website and sponsor me</a>, all in aid of Prostate Cancer Research.</p>
<p>The photos show the progress (or lack thereof) for those who wanted proof and haven&#8217;t seen me in person <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Those of you who know me in person (as opposed to some disembodied Twitterer or blog poster) will know that growing hair isn&#8217;t one of my strong areas.</p>
<p>Why then, would I sign up for <a href="http://uk.movember.com/">Movember</a>? Well, apart from it being an <a href="http://www.prostate-cancer.org.uk/">excellent cause</a> to which we should all give generously and be more aware, it&#8217;s also an experiment to see whether it&#8217;s just the top of my head that&#8217;s follically challenged or if my top lip will also betray me.</p>
<p>So what do you need to do? Well two things. Number one, and most importantly, is to visit <a href="http://uk.movember.com/mospace/294156">this page</a> and pledge a little bit of cash to the Prostate Cancer Charity. Second, just sit back and see just how grand a &#8220;Mo&#8221; I can grow in 30 days. Very exciting isn&#8217;t it?</p>
