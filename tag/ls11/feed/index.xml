										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well that&#8217;s it, another Lotusphere is over. I&#8217;m sat here in the Dolphin rotunda waiting for my LDC compatriots to check out, just watching the occasional yellow back pack head towards the checkout line, it&#8217;s always a sad sight. But on the other hand I am absolutely exhausted after the most hectic &#8216;sphere ever.</p>
<p>Every year i think that I can&#8217;t possibly do any more, but every year i prove myself wrong. This year for the first time in a while I actually got to attend sessions which were (with one unfortunate exception) superb, the track managers really do a great job.</p>
<p>With my three different work hats of Elguji, LDC and XPages101 there are many different tasks to get through, and from the point of view it was an incredibly successful week, if this week is anything to go by then 2011 is going to be a good year, budgets seem to be freeing up after a tough couple of years.</p>
<p>Tim Clark and I had our two sessions on Tuesday and barring some minor errors they have been well received. If you&#8217;re looking for the slide deck, then click <a href="/presentations/">presentations</a> link at the top of this page. Presenting with Tim really is great fun, we seem to have a good rapport on stage so it reduces the (still almost overpowering) nerves I get before speaking to such large and well informed audiences.</p>
<p>&lt;I stopped typing at the Dolphin here and flew home&gt;</p>
<p>I should mention Mark Myers who not only put in a huge amount of work on preparing the LDC t-shirts which so many people seemed to like (well they were all gone by Tuesday evening anyway!). The fact that he also won the Lotus Idol competition was great news for him, I&#8217;d never been to that before and it was great fun and good to see such talented speakers coming through. The competition to speak next year has become even harder I would say.</p>
<p>Of course the social side of things was as manic as ever, i managed to escape with just a couple of really late nights, there&#8217;s too much to do during the day to go for a full &#8220;wild Bill&#8221; week, I simply have no idea how those guys manage it.</p>
<p>On the wider view of things I still need to let things mull in my head for a while. I have a feeling that we have seen a very significant shift this week. The focus of the OGS on business rather than technology was the most obvious manifestation of this change i think. I&#8217;m not entirely convinced that ignoring the really impressive tools IBM have to show is the right way to go in the long run, however if the plan is to move away from the Lotus branding and even drop the Notes / Domino name to draw a line in the sand for what is currently Notes Next then you won&#8217;t hear any complaints from me.</p>
<p>In terms of the technical content (from which we were untroubled in the OGS) this really was the year that XPages came to the fore. The number of people who attended my sessions and every other XPages session I went to, plus the sales of the book really show that there is genuine interest in this technology. This is &#8220;A Good Thing&#8221;&trade; not just from a personal point of view with the last two years of my life beginning to pay off, but also from a Notes Domino view bringing app dev up to a level that it can reasonably compete with the other platforms out there.</p>
<p>And now to take some advice from the best t-shirt of the week&#8230;</p>
<p>&lt;/bitching&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;doing&gt;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the annual pilgrimage to Florida for Lotusphere begins, I thought it would be worth mentioning a discount for <a href="http://xpages101.net/">XPages101</a> which I&#8217;ll be offering for the next 3 weeks.</p>
<p>Use the coupon code &#8220;ls11&#8221; at checkout and get a 33% discount!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s coming up to a year since I first launched the site and in that time I&#8217;ve uploaded 37 lessons which run to more than 7 hours of content and well over 2gb of movies. There are many more lessons planned over the coming weeks and months.</p>
<p>So if you feel like it&#8217;s time to get into XPages, or you&#8217;re just looking for a bit of a helping hand with some of the more complex tasks in Domino Designer then hopefully my videos will be able to help you. <a href="http://xpages101.net/videos">Check them out</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As you may have <a href="http://www.bruceelgort.com/blogs/be.nsf/plinks/BELT-8BXQDL">seen over the last week</a>, there are <a href="http://stickfight.co.uk/">several</a> <a href="http://benpoole.com/">of</a> <a href="http://dominoyesmaybe.blogspot.com/">us</a> in the Lotus community who are gathering together to organise a fund raising event at <a href="http://lotusphere.com/">Lotusphere 2011</a>.</p>
<p>The inspiration came from <a href="http://stickfight.co.uk/">Mark Myers</a> and <a href="http://benpoole.com/">Ben Poole</a>, who, in a rare moment of non bickering, specified and arranged the creation of the &#8220;It&#8217;s a small Lotus world&#8221; pixel art. <a href="http://bruceelgort.com/">Bruce</a> then came up with the idea of raffling a very nicely framed version of the art (complete with key of all of the &#8220;inside baseball&#8221; references hidden away).Then <a href="http://dominoyesmaybe.blogspot.com/">Steve McDonagh</a> very kindly decided to enter the fray with his <a href="http://dominoyesmaybe.blogspot.com/2010/12/extra-items-for-its-small-lotus-world.html">Map of the Lands of Lotii</a>.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s the deal? Well, over the next few weeks, and at Lotusphere itself, we are selling raffle tickets. They are $10 each. Then at <a href="http://www.elsmore.net/warren/blog.nsf/d6plinks/WELE-8BPD72">UK Night at Lotusphere</a> (on the Monday night) we will be holding the grand prize draw for the framed pixel art, and Mr McD&#8217;s art work.&nbsp;</p>

<p>or you can collar Bruce, Gayle, Mark, Julian Woodward or myself at Lotusphere to buy a ticket from us direct.</p>
<form action="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr" method="post">The aim of all of this, apart from being fun, is that we raise as much money as possible for the <a href="http://www.joyrx.org/">Children&#8217;s Cancer Association</a>, which is a great charity that provides support to seriously ill children and their families.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, dig deep, buy as many tickets as you can afford and you may well be walking away from Lotusphere with some amazing artwork to hang on your office wall. (If you&#8217;re not going to Lotusphere then of course we&#8217;ll ship the prize to you.)</p>
<p>One of the things we&#8217;re doing over the next few weeks is gradually revealing different sections of the pixel art image, so here is this week&#8217;s image in which we see the iEd&#8217;s store.</p>
