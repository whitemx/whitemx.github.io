										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I can&#8217;t imagine why you&#8217;ve not seen this news, but just in case, with the release of Notes / Domino 8.5.1 next Monday, <a href="http://www.edbrill.com/ebrill/edbrill.nsf/dx/announcing-notesdomino-8.5.1-part-1-free-domino-designer">Domino Designer will now be free</a>.</p>
<p>This is huge news for the platform, as it means that anyone can download and have a play with 8.5.1 which is the first really good version of Domino Designer on Eclipse. It means that you can have a play with XPages without having to worry about CALs. And I&#8217;d really recommend taking that look, whereas XPages in 8.5.0 were very much a &#8220;dot zero&#8221; release, with 8.5.1 we have a vastly improved dev environment and hugely increased performance and stability on the server side.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re in any doubt about what you can achieve with XPages in a relatively short amount of time (i.e. less than it took us to develop the first version of IdeaJam), then have a look at <a href="http://iqjam.net/">http://IQJam.net/</a>, the first commercially available application developed specifically for Domino 8.5.1 using XPages.</p>
