										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s been one of those really great weekends where everything is very chilled out and goes right. One of those things was an evening last night playing a board game that had completely passed me by until now.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Settlers_of_Catan">The Settlers of Catan</a> is like a cross between Monopoly, Risk and Civilisation. Our single game lasted around three hours and generated a huge amount of bargaining, nastiness and laughter. If you&#8217;re looking for a game which will while away several hours, requires a lot of strategy and is actually quite challenging then this is the game for you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Those of you who know me in person (as opposed to some disembodied Twitterer or blog poster) will know that growing hair isn&#8217;t one of my strong areas.</p>
<p>Why then, would I sign up for <a href="http://uk.movember.com/">Movember</a>? Well, apart from it being an <a href="http://www.prostate-cancer.org.uk/">excellent cause</a> to which we should all give generously and be more aware, it&#8217;s also an experiment to see whether it&#8217;s just the top of my head that&#8217;s follically challenged or if my top lip will also betray me.</p>
<p>So what do you need to do? Well two things. Number one, and most importantly, is to visit <a href="http://uk.movember.com/mospace/294156">this page</a> and pledge a little bit of cash to the Prostate Cancer Charity. Second, just sit back and see just how grand a &#8220;Mo&#8221; I can grow in 30 days. Very exciting isn&#8217;t it?</p>
