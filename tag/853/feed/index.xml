										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I suppose most of you know about <a href="http://xpages101.net/">XPages101</a> now, the first eight videos on the site walk you through creating a new XPages application. I recorded them two years ago now and they are still useful when you&#8217;re starting with XPages. But since 8.5.3 and more specifically UP1 (or the Extension Library) became main stream my eight videos can make things seem a little like too much work.</p>
<p>So over the next few weeks at XPages101 I will walk you through creating roughly the same application using the more up to date tools available to us. What&#8217;s interesting is that I have recorded three videos already (the first one was released yesterday <a href="http://xpages101.net/xpages101/XPages101.nsf/0/01E576D528A968CD802579A7004CF962">here</a>) and have already reached the point of having a functional application with navigation and UI. It&#8217;s obviously not a scientific measure, but the extra controls which are provided for us out the box with UP1 (or ExtLib) really make a difference in development time.</p>
<p>Anyway, if you&#8217;re a subscriber then go ahead and check out the <a href="http://xpages101.net/xpages101/XPages101.nsf/0/01E576D528A968CD802579A7004CF962">new video which I uploaded yesterday</a>, if you&#8217;re not a subscriber&#8230; well, I shall say nothing!</p>
