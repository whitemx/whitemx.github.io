										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week I (and several other&#8217;s from the UK) headed over to Brussels for the Benelux Lotus User Group (BLUG) being run by <a href="http://www.xceed.be/Blog.nsf">Theo Heselmans</a> and others. The first thing to say is that, from a speaker&#8217;s point of view, Theo has really raised the bar for us involved with ILUG and UKLUG. We were treated unbelievably well, I can&#8217;t thank all of the people involved enough for the hospitality they showed us.</p>
<p>But the really important thing is the content on the day itself. From what I could tell the 200+ people were very happy. The morning was given over to the &#8220;official word&#8221; from no less than Alastair Rennie. He gave an interesting rehash of the Lotusphere OGS, there&#8217;s always good content in there that gets missed the first time around. You can see the <a href="http://www.blug.be/blug.nsf/Pages/Event20100330_Live">live blog of the OGS here</a>.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the BLUG organisers tried a different approach with up to five concurrent sessions running at any one time. It certainly suited the venue which had plenty of slightly smaller rooms. So in the room I was speaking in we basically had a three hour XPages geek fest with sessions from <a href="http://www.tc-soft.com/wordpress/">Tim Clark</a> and <a href="http://hermes.intec.co.uk/intec/blog.nsf">Paul Withers</a> along with mine. Right through the afternoon the room was packed and no one walked out which is always a good sign of people actually getting value from our speaking <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>&lt;selfpromotion&gt;I&#8217;ve published the slides and supporting database for my session over on my <a href="/presentations/">presentations page</a>&nbsp;so feel free to download it. Also don&#8217;t forget the &#8220;blug2010&#8221; coupon code for <a href="http://xpages101.net/">XPages101.net</a>. &lt;/selfpromotion&gt;</p>
<p>As always the best thing about User Groups anywhere in the world is the new people you meet, so it was goof to finally put some faces to names I&#8217;ve known for a long time in the Lotus Community and also meet some completely new people as well.</p>
<p>This month is turning into a bit of a travel / community affair with upcoming trips for me to <a href="http://www.clearitconsulting.nl/site/site.nsf/webcontent/CDRH-82GK3T">Amsterdam next week for a two day XPages course</a>&nbsp;(I think there are a couple of spaces still free if you want to come along) and then <a href="http://www.dannotes.dk/">Dannotes the week after in Denmark</a>.</p>
<p>For anyone organising community events, then Theo et al have certainly raised the bar.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Monday I&#8217;m jumping on the train to Brussels for a couple of days to enjoy the <a href="http://www.blug.be/">Belux Lotus User Group</a> meeting. It&#8217;s promising to be a really interesting event with some great speakers lined up, and a keynote from none other than Alistair Rennie. This is a huge coup for <a href="http://www.xceed.be/Blog.nsf">Theo</a> and the rest of the organisers to have lined up.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be presenting a session on XPages development (who&#8217;d have thunk it?) and there are other really interesting looking sessions from Tim Clark, Paul Withers, Stuart McIntyre, Warren Elsmore, Gabriella Davis, Eileen Fitzgerald and Thomas Bahn, and they&#8217;re just the people I know. I&#8217;m really looking forward to seeing several of them as I didn&#8217;t get to see much as Lotusphere.</p>
<p>The event is looking like it will be great fun, so if you see me wandering around stop me and say Hi.</p>
<p>Also, in celebration of the event, I&#8217;ve set up a coupon code for <a href="http://xpages101.net/">XPages101.net</a> which will run for a couple of weeks. Just enter &#8220;blug2010&#8221; at checkout for a big discount on the cost for access to a large, and growing, suite of videos about XPages development.</p>
