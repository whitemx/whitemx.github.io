					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;We&#039;re with them too but thanks to Matt&#039;s job we get a reduction, our payment is £6 per month for everything! I have a mobile handset Samsung E700 with charger hands free kit and original box etc going if anyone&#039;s interested? let me know.Having played cricket at the weekend I feel veri fit and healthy, my new team I play for lost by 1 run! I scored a 4 and another run before being caught. Playing again in 2 weeks time, they must be impressed as it&#039;s Norfolk &amp; Suffolk league! They are going to teach me to bowl too. Thank you Woodbridge Ladies Cricket Club&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>
