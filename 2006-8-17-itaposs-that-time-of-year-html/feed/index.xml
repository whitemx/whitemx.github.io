					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I was searching from Friday thru to Saturday so I guess it&#039;s just the dates and I was searching using the conference site not direct with the hotel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course I&#039;m going, this&#039;ll be year number 8 I think. I&#039;ve even put in a couple of abstracts to see if I can get to speak this year. How about you?&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>
