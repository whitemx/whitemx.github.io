					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Great minds do think alike what a fantastic idea, now all we need is affordable Ipods, Matt &amp; I watched a gadget programme last night and it compared the prices in London, New York and Toronto, Canada an ■80 difference in 5 different gadget christmas presies! and as usual they worked around the reason why. Interesting programme though. Just imagine that nice music system SImon has witha built in projector! &lt;/p&gt;]]></description>
