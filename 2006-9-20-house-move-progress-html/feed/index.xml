					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;You mean Heathrow doesn&#039;t count? &lt;img src=&quot;&lt;a  rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;http://www.11tmr.com/11tmr.nsf/emoticons/DLYH-5MZVLU/$FILE/wink.gif&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sad thing is I&#039;ve probably changed planes at Heathrow 4 or 5 times in the last 6 years, but never ventured out.  Paul is twisting my arm to come to ILUG next year, so perhaps I&#039;ll make it yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t suppose my 15 year-old BT phone cards would still work? Oh, and I probably have 20-30 quid in small change, but I&#039;m pretty sure those aren&#039;t collector&#039;s items yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please give my regards to Horatio.  He&#039;ll remember me...I was the drunk bloke in the square at New Year&#039;s 1992 &lt;img src=&quot;&lt;a  rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;http://www.11tmr.com/11tmr.nsf/emoticons/DLYH-5N3GKU/$FILE/tongue.gif&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;The East London line isn&#039;t new but it&#039;s very short so a bit ignored by the world. There are plans to extend it both north and south but not for another 5 years or so. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DLR is getting pretty big these days, it runs south of the river to Lewisham (going under the river at Greenwich as you said), and it also runs right down to Woolwich on the north side of the river as well. A pretty good service all round actually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nelson is still there but looking somewhat different as they have been working on restoring him all this summer for the first time in 25 years or so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You need to get over here to see how things have changed since you were last here!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matt&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I see it (google maps).  Don&#039;t have my 15-year-old tube map in front of me, but is the &quot;East London Line&quot; new like the Jubilee?  Also looks like the DLR has expanded a good bit...does it go under the River at Island Gardens - Greenwich, or is that a separate line on the south side?  Very weird...last time I was there was before the Internet and mobile phones were common...so much has changed.  Is Nelson at least still in Trafalgar Square? &lt;img src=&quot;&lt;a  rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;http://www.11tmr.com/11tmr.nsf/emoticons/DLYH-5MZVLY/$FILE/smile.gif&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Your London geography sounds spot on. The flat is in Surrey Quays, on the south bank of the Thames and a five minute walk from Surrey Quays tube station. That&#039;s on the East London line which means I can get onto the Jubilee which runs to London Bridge (I am working a ten minute walk from there) or up to the District line from where I can get to Monument or Liverpool Street both of which are a five minute walk from the office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matt&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Congratulations Matt!  I lived on the Isle of Dogs for several months back in the early &#039;90s, when Canary Wharf was in its infancy.  I take it from your description this puts you on the south side of the river, north of Greenwich, but I&#039;m curious if you get to see good sunrises or sunsets.  Also, what transit line would you take?  I understand the Jubilee line comes to Greenwich, but I don&#039;t think that&#039;ll get you easily to Liverpool Street (although I may be confused about your current work location).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just overhauled my own commute here in DC by bying an electric assist bicycle.  I can cover in 25 minutes what used to take 45 by foot - subway - foot, or 35 by foot - subway - cab (adding $8 to the cost).  The electric assist comes in handy because one goal I had was not to have to change clothes/shower.  Since its mostly uphill on the way home, the electric assist also keeps my return time down to 30-35 minutes whereas a regular bike might require 50+.  I understand this arrangement is more common in the UK/Europe, but so far I&#039;m the only person I know here with one (although lots of folks ride regular bikes).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now I&#039;ll think of you every time I catch the opening to a rerun of EastEnders &lt;img src=&quot;&lt;a  rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;http://www.11tmr.com/11tmr.nsf/emoticons/DLYH-5MZVLY/$FILE/smile.gif&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>
